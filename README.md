Summer 2023 Research Project at the Vehicular Edge Computing and Security REU, UNT


As recent literature suggests the need for communication between autonomous vehicles, edge devices have emerged as a viable conduit to facilitate real-time data sharing. Edge devices strike a suitable medium between the alternatives of cloud centralization and full vehicle-to-vehicle decentralization, providing the computational savings of sending and receiving information from one place while also boosting speed by bypassing internet protocols. Given the novelty of both object detection models and autonomous vehicle-oriented edge device implementation, there are no standards for hardware and software specifications on the edge. In this project, we seek to address this void, investigating the GPU and CPU usage patterns of various object detection models and machine learning frameworks. We also aim to uncover optimization opportunities such as workload pipelining.
